# rainbow-fs

> A utility library for reading/writing/mutating serialized items from Unicorn for Sitecore.

### What is rainbow-fs?

**rainbow-fs** is very much a work in progress.  It is meant to be a comprehensive utility library to manage serialized Sitecore content trees from Unicorn.
The current implementation can:

- Read serialized items from the file system.
- Write items to the file system.
- Load Unicorn predicate configurations from XML configuration patch files.
- Create new items using deterministic GUIDs.
- Perform basic operations on an item:
  - Rename
  - Rebase
  - Change field values
  - Add/Remove Langauges
  - Add/Remove Versions
- Find items using standard glob patterns
